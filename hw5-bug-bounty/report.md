# Protocol Summary

Protocol does X, Y, Z

# Disclaimer

The HSE web3 team makes all effort to find as many vulnerabilities in the code in the given time period, but holds no responsibilities for the findings provided in this document. A security audit by the team is not an endorsement of the underlying business or product. The audit was time-boxed and the review of the code was solely on the security aspects of the Solidity implementation of the contracts.

# Risk Classification

|            |        | Impact |        |     |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | --- |
|            |        | High   | Medium | Low |
|            | High   | H      | H/M    | M   |
| Likelihood | Medium | H/M    | M      | M/L |
|            | Low    | M      | M/L    | L   |

We use the [CodeHawks](https://docs.codehawks.com/hawks-auditors/how-to-evaluate-a-finding-severity) severity matrix to determine severity. See the documentation for more details.

All vulnerabilities discovered during the audit are classified based on their potential severity and have the following classification:

| Severity | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High     | Bugs leading to assets theft, fund access locking, or any other loss of funds and bugs that can trigger a contract failure. Further recovery is possible only by manual modification of the contract state or replacement. |
| Medium   | Bugs that can break the intended contract logic or expose it to DoS attacks, but do not cause direct loss funds.                                                                                                           |
| Low      | Bugs that do not have a significant immediate impact and could be easily fixed.                                                                                                                                            |
| Gas      | Bugs that are tied to unnecessary wasted gas.                                                                                                                                                                              |
